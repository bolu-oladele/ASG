    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        Every athlete needs a steady foundation—something firm to hold onto through the highs of victory and the challenges of competition. That’s why Anchor Sports Group (ASG) was created: to provide athletes with more than management, but with true partnership, mentorship, and faith-centered guidance.

        Our name is our mission. Just as an anchor keeps a ship steady in rough waters, we exist to keep our athletes grounded—helping them remain true to who they are while navigating the ever-changing landscape of professional sports.

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>

    <p>
        Anchor Sports Group is not just an agency; we are a team of advocates, advisors, and mentors united by a higher calling. We combine industry knowledge with biblical principles to create a holistic approach to athlete management. For us, it’s not simply about winning contracts—it’s about winning with integrity, shaping character, and preparing athletes for a purpose that goes beyond the playing field.

        We know the demands athletes face: the pressure to perform, the glare of the spotlight, the uncertainty of what comes next. That’s why ASG offers not only professional expertise but also spiritual and personal support. We walk beside our athletes through every decision, every season, and every transition—because their well-being matters as much as their performance.

        Our mission is simple yet profound: to stand firmly beside athletes as their anchor. We are committed to guiding their careers with wisdom, protecting their interests with integrity, and encouraging them to use their God-given gifts to influence the world for good.

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
        We dream of a future where athletes are defined not just by stats or trophies, but by the legacy of faith, leadership, and service they leave behind. At ASG, success is measured not only in championships, but in character—how athletes inspire others, invest in their communities, and impact lives long after their playing days are over.
